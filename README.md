# HackerRank-30day-C-

Our Story
Back in 2008, Vivek Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi worked as software engineers at Amazon and IBM, respectively, spending way too much time on engineering interviews. The duo wished they could focus more energy on building innovative products and less energy screening resumes and interviewing. Plus, it was really hard to spot great programmers using traditional recruiting methods.

Together, they built automatic CodeChallenges that not only cut thousands of hours in recruiting collectively but also helped flatten the world by promoting a meritocracy. This innovation earned a spot at the prestigious Y Combinator startup accelerator program. And so HackerRank was born.
